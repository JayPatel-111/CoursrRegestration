The Course Management System is a key project for universities and students.
It facilitates course management by allowing two types of users: Admin and User. 
Admins have the capability to manage the system by adding or modifying courses
and overseeing user registrations. Users, including students and faculty, 
can register for courses, view available courses, and access up-to-date information.

This system utilizes PHP and MySQL for backend operations, HTML for the frontend,
and CSS for styling, ensuring a secure and efficient online course management experience.
